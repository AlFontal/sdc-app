<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlFontal/sdcpy-app/master/static/sdcpy_logo_black.png" width="200" height="250" />

Simple web app built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and hosted in Heroku to enable a web-based 
GUI for Scale Dependent Correlation analysis.

Current deployment of the app (still in the very *alpha* phase) can be accessed in https://sdcpy-app.herokuapp.com/.
